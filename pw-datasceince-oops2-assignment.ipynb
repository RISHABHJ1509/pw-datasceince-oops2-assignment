    "'''\n",
    "\n",
    " Encapsulation revolves around two key principles: access control and data hiding.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Access Control:\n",
    "Encapsulation allows you to control the access to certain components (attributes and methods) of a class. \n",
    "In most object-oriented programming languages, there are three types of access control:\n",
    "\n",
    "Public: These attributes and methods are accessible from anywhere. They can be freely accessed and modified \n",
    "from outside the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Private: Private attributes and methods are only accessible within the class that defines them. In many languages\n",
    "like Python, this is achieved by using a naming convention (e.g., prefixing attributes/methods with double underscores __)\n",
    "to make them less accessible from outside the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Protected: Protected attributes and methods are accessible within the class itself and its subclasses (derived classes). \n",
    "In some languages, this is denoted by a single underscore _ convention, but in Python, it's more of a naming convention \n",
    "to indicate that it should be treated as protected.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Data Hiding:\n",
    "Data hiding is the concept of hiding the internal state of an object from the outside world and providing controlled \n",
    "access to it. This is done to ensure that the object's state is accessed and modified only through well-defined interfaces\n",
    "(methods) provided by the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Private Data: By making certain attributes private, their values can only be modified or accessed through the class's\n",
    "methods, allowing the class to have control over how its data is manipulated.\n",

    "Encapsulation of Behavior: Encapsulation not only hides data but also encapsulates behavior by bundling the methods that\n",
    "manipulate that data within the same class. This ensures that the object's data is modified in a controlled manner,\n",
